Informatics Judge is a project I'm trying to do in my free time in order to get more familiar with the languages I'm using. The part which is responsible for compiling and running programs is written in Scala. 

The languages that are supported are Scala and C++. The program creates processes which compile the given code and run it with several input written in advance, and checks the tested program's output with the expected one. Since the the judge runs locally, the necessary compiler must be installed on the machine. I am using GNU GCC compiler for C++ and Scala 2.13.4 for my programs.

I hope I will be able to expand that project in the future by creating a Website which will allow users to upload their solutions to given problems and then compile and test the given solutions.

The testScala.scala and testCpp.cpp files that are given are example solutions to the problem "Read an integer and return its square and cube". I am using them to test the judge. The input and output files for that problem are in the Problem1 folder.

I will be happy to hear any sort of feedback.
